This repository holds the attack files for Group 1's final project

# Individual Contributions

#### Jacob Membrino: My contributions include beginning the report paper and the slides for the demonstration. I built the slides and added the text to them. I wrote the report's Intro, Threat Model, and Implementation sections. I built the treat model diagram based on the collaborative work I did to develop the attack. I studied Autoware’s documentation to bug fix. I also put detailed instructions on how to push my team’s code to GitHub by extending their repository to a remote desktop, which requires a personal access token that can only be generated in a hidden section of GitHub buried in the settings section of one’s profile under ‘developer settings.’ Lastly, I attempted to fix an issue relating to Autoware being unable to receive packets from our python script but wasn’t lucky enough to solve it.
